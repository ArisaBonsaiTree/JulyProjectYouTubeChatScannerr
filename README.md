# YouTubeChatScannerJulyProject

I got a job as an Integration Engineer and want to keep my programming skills sharp. That is why every month I'll work on some big project.


For this project, I'll be expanding my https://github.com/ArisaBonsaiTree/YouTube project by adding a working GUI that will allow you to now only scan YouTube chat data, but also download the video, and if I can do some basic editing on Adobe Premiere Pro.
