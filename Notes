Need FFmpeg in our PATH --> need FFmpeg as an exe

Pass By Value --> A copy is made. The actual value DOES NOT CHANGE

def fun(a):
    a+=10
    print("Inside function call",a)

a=20
print("Before function call",a)
fun(a)
print("After function call",a)
Python
Copy

Output:

Before function call 20
Inside function call 30
After function call 20

======================

Pass By Reference --> The original is passed and the actual value is changed

def fun(a):
    a.append('i')
    print("Inside function call",a)

a=['H']
print("Before function call",a)
fun(a)
print("After function call",a)
Python
Copy

Output:

Before function call ['H']
Inside function call ['H', 'i']
After function call ['H', 'i']
